As a frequent traveler I don't have a lot of time to research my purchases. I want useful info available immediately, not just fluff, so that I can make decisions quicker.

User 2 - Sam - focus group

As a socially-conscience consumer I want items that do not contribute to environmental problems or contribute to social inequality globally, so that I can know I'm not part of the problem.

As a old-school number cruncher I need clear data presented in a modular so I can look at it from every angle.

User 4 - Hakim - researcher
I am a contracted consumer analyst.  I need a presentation that does not influence the consumers choices in order to accurrately plan product photos and copy.
